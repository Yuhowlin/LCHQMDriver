"""Long-time (spectroscopy) cryoscope probe: vendor code only (qm/quam) — no qualibrate, no scqo.

Flux-line step response by qubit spectroscopy vs wait-time INTO a parked flux
pulse. Sequence per (detuning, wait): reset -> set the drive near the parked
qubit frequency (``df + IF + center_offset_hz``) -> play a long flux ``const``
pulse -> wait ``t`` into it -> play a long, weak SHAPED spectroscopy pulse
-> readout. Per wait-time the spectroscopy peak center gives the qubit frequency,
which maps to the delivered flux; the flux settling is fit downstream to a sum of
exponentials. This reaches the microsecond tails the Ramsey cryoscope cannot.

SPECTROSCOPY DRIVE: the tone is a RUN-SCOPED operation built by
:func:`install_drive_op` — the ``drive_shape`` envelope (square / cosine / gaussian)
at exactly ``operation_len_ns`` (on the 4 ns grid), at the amplitude that holds the
calibrated x180 ROTATION AREA (peak amplitude x length x envelope average/peak —
the envelope factor matters: see :func:`drive_amp_for_area`), so a longer pulse is
a proportionally weaker one and the tone stays a true pi pulse. It is played BARE:
no ``duration=`` stretch and no ``amplitude_scale``, so QUA's +/-2 ``amp()`` bound
never binds here. The line is then Fourier-limited at a constant set by the
envelope (FWHM x length = 0.799 square, 1.095 gaussian at sigma=T/4, 1.334 cosine)
— LENGTH sets the width, SHAPE sets how clean it is. A square tone's 11.6%
shoulders at +/- ~8.9 / length are RABI-NUTATION lobes (an AREA effect, not a sinc
sidelobe, so a flat top does not remove them) and they bias the estimator's
single-Lorentzian center by a few percent of the FWHM — the size of the settling
being tracked. The flux ``const`` is held for the wait PLUS this drive length plus
a fixed tail, so it always fully brackets the drive.

RUN-SCOPED OP LIFECYCLE: ``probe()`` files the built pulse on ``qubit.xy`` under
:data:`DRIVE_OP` and the shell's ``run()`` drops it in a ``finally``. The window is
exactly right: ``machine.generate_config()`` runs INSIDE ``_lib.acquire`` (after
``probe()`` has returned), while ``machine.save()`` — the only path that could
persist the op into ``state.json`` — runs much later, on accept/update. Same
recorded set -> revert discipline as
``scqo.experiments._drive_power.drive_power_boundary``. ``--preview`` does not go
through ``run()``, so the op is still on the tree when ``QMBackend.preview``
generates its config (the dumped script and the gateway waveform view are both
correct) and is left on the IN-MEMORY tree afterwards; a preview is its own process
and saves nothing, and :func:`install_drive_op` drops a stale copy first, so a
leftover can never be played.

PULSE CONTRACT: ``flux_amp_v`` is the parked flux amplitude in VOLTS measured
from the standing DC bias ``initialize_qpu`` applies — the z ``const`` rides on
that offset, so it is idle-relative. ``flux_point`` is passed EXPLICITLY because
the DAC emits ``idle + excursion`` and the number validated against the rail must
be the number that plays.

CENTER OFFSET: ``center_offset_hz`` is the arch-predicted parked detuning the
scqo experiment computes; the drive is shifted by it (NO LO shift — band-limited)
so the spectroscopy window stays centered on the peak. It is a plain frequency
shift added to ``update_frequency``.

Single qubit only: the sequence is built per qubit (one parked drive, one flux
line, one wait axis); run targets one at a time.

QM long-time (spectroscopy) cryoscope for scqo — supplies only ``probe()``.

Parameters, the spectroscopy-cryoscope estimator and the paired-fact writeback
are inherited from ``scqo.experiments.QubitSpectroscopyCryoscope``. scqo sweeps
the drive DETUNING (``detuning_hz``) x the (log-spaced) WAIT time
(``wait_time_ns``) into a parked flux pulse; the QM builder realizes it with a
held ``const`` flux, a wait, and a fixed ``x180`` spectroscopy pulse.

Unlike the Ramsey cryoscope, there is NO baking — a plain stretched ``const`` plus
the run-scoped drive op — so ``probe()`` returns ``(program, sweep_axes)`` and the
backend's shared fetch path runs it (no per-call baked config to thread through):
filing the op on the QUAM tree is enough, because the config is generated after
``probe()``.

Single target: the probe refuses more than one qubit (one parked drive + one flux
line + one wait axis); reset is resolved through ``_reset.check_reset_method`` so
``reset_method="active"`` is refused by name. The drive is centered on the
arch-predicted parked detuning ``resolved_center_offset_hz`` (no LO shift —
band-limited v1) and its envelope, length and amplitude come from ``drive_shape`` /
``drive_len_ns`` / ``drive_sigma_frac`` / ``drive_amp_factor``.
