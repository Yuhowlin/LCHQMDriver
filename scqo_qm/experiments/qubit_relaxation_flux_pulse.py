"""T1 vs Flux spectrum acquisition probe: vendor code only (qm/quam).

PULSE CONTRACT: `flux_amps_v` are VOLTS measured from the standing DC bias that
`initialize_qpu` applies -- the z `const` pulse rides on top of that offset, so
the axis is idle-relative and 0 V means "stay parked". `flux_point` selects which
named offset stands, and it is passed EXPLICITLY (rather than leaning on
quam_builder's "joint" default) because the same value has to reach the rail
validation below: the DAC emits idle + excursion, so the number that was checked
must be the number that plays.

QM qubit relaxation vs flux PULSE (T1 spectrum) for scqo - supplies only ``probe()``.

Parameters, fit, and reporting are inherited from
``scqo.experiments.QubitRelaxationFluxPulse``.

PULSE CONTRACT: this probe conforms to the ``_pulse`` name by construction - the
z bias is a ``const`` PULSE played during the idle delay
(``scqo_qm/probes/qubit_relaxation_flux.py``), which the DAC adds to the
standing offset ``initialize_qpu`` applies, so ``flux_bias_v`` is an excursion
FROM ``idle_flux`` and 0 V means "stay parked". ``flux_point`` is passed
explicitly for the reason the probe documents: the bias that was rail-validated
must be the bias that plays. The probe MODULE keeps its historical name (it is
shared with the qualibrate ``LCH_T1_spectrum`` shell).
