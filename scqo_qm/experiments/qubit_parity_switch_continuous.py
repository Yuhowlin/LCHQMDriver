"""Continuous charge-parity monitor acquisition probe: vendor code only (qm/quam) - no qualibrate, no scqo, no scqat.

y90 - fixed idle - x90 - measure, repeated as `num_shots` back-to-back single
shots. (The two-measurement-per-cycle sibling is
`qubit_parity_switch_discrete.py`.) The 90-degree-SHIFTED second pulse measures sin of the parity-dependent
phase (+/- pi/2 at the intended idle), which is ODD in parity, so the two charge
parities land on opposite readout poles; a same-axis pair would measure the even
cos and see no parity at all.

Two deliberate absences, both load-bearing:

* **No `qubit.reset(...)`.** Between shots only the RESONATOR is waited out
  (its depletion time), and the absence of a qubit reset is REQUIRED rather
  than an optimization: the sequence inverts with the pole the previous shot
  left behind, so the readout is the running XOR of the parity and the
  consecutive-pair difference is the parity telegraph the rate is fitted from.
  Resetting to |0> each shot would sever that chain. The shot cadence is also
  the telegraph timebase — a thermal wait would stretch it by orders of
  magnitude and scale every reported rate with it.
* **No `.average()` in the stream processing.** Every shot is its own sample of
  the telegraph; averaging them is exactly the information being measured.
  (The legacy `calibrations/exclude/LCH_parity_switch_ramsey.py` node carried a
  `.buffer(n).average()` that was a no-op only because a single buffer was ever
  produced.)

`idle_cycles` and `depletion_cycles` are per-qubit-name dicts of 4 ns clock
cycles; the caller (the scqo shell) owns the ns->cycles conversion and the
precedence between a per-run override and the standing QUAM value.

WHY THIS DOES NOT CALL `qubit.readout_state()` in discriminated mode, unlike
every other per-shot probe here: that helper ENDS with its own
`wait(resonator.depletion_time // 4)`. On top of this program's own
between-shot wait that is two depletion waits per shot — the cadence, and
therefore every reported rate, off by the difference — and it would also make
the per-run `readout_depletion_ns` override apply to only one of them. The
threshold assign is three lines of the same vendor API, so the wait keeps
exactly one owner. (The threshold itself still comes from the QUAM readout
operation, i.e. scqo's accepted `readout_threshold` knob.)

QM continuous charge-parity monitor for scqo - supplies only ``probe()``.

Parameters, the REFUSE gates (a stored ``parity_delta_f_hz`` for the fixed
idle, a governed depletion wait for the shot cadence, stored blob centers for
the trace discrimination), the telegraph-PSD fit and the ``parity_rate_hz``
writeback are all inherited from
``scqo.experiments.QubitParitySwitchContinuous``. This class only converts the
resolved ns values into QUA clock cycles and reports the scheduled shot period
back to the neutral layer.

PER-SHOT contract: every shot is recorded individually — the probe's streams
are ``buffer(num_shots)`` with NO ``.average()``.

NOT MULTIPLEXED, on purpose. Each qubit gets its own batch, so its shot cadence
is its own; in a multiplexed batch the ``align()``s tie every qubit's period to
the slowest member, and that period is exactly what each qubit's switching rate
is divided by.
